# writeups
My cybersecurity learning path, labs, and SOC writeups.

# 👋 Hi, I'm Radek

Welcome to my cybersecurity learning journal.  
I document hands-on labs, SOC exercises and practical notes from my learning path.  
This repo is a living log of my progress — focused on concrete results and short writeups.

---

### 📘 Current focus
- **TryHackMe: Security 101** — in progress (Pre-security finished; Security 101 ~30% done).  
- **SOC Level 1 (TryHackMe)** — next on the list after Security 101.  
- **Goal:** build practical SOC skills (triage, logs, detection) rather than collecting certificates only.

> Note: I prefer to keep this README stable and add only real achievements (completed labs / published writeups).

---

### 🧠 What I plan to add (roadmap)
- Basic SIEM queries & simple detection rules (Splunk / ELK examples)  
- Small automation scripts for enrichment (IP/Hash lookup) — read-only tools first  
- 1 writeup per month: concise, reproducible, and honest about what I did

---

### ✅ Achievements
- Completed: **Pre-Security (TryHackMe)**  
- In progress: **Security 101 (TryHackMe)**  
- Public writeups: (see `/labs` folder — updates appear here as I finish them)

### 🛠️ Tools I’m working with / learning
`curl` • `nmap` • `Wireshark` • `Python` • `Bash` • (future: `Splunk` / `ELK` / `Sigma`)

---

### 🧾 Typical writeup structure I publish
Each lab writeup contains:
1. short executive summary  
2. environment and steps (reproducible)  
3. evidence (screenshots / log snippets)  
4. one detection query or one automation script (where applicable)  
5. lessons learned & next steps
